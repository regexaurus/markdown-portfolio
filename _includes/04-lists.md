These are a few of my favorite things :heart: :gift::

1. [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting). Particularly [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/running-remote-commands). See [the gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com) for inspiration.
2. Aviation of all types but especially smaller bush planes, with fat tires. A dream is to do **something** in the great/remote outback with a private pilote license, flying a small plane to get around. :small_airplane: More realistically, I need to get started with a RC multirotor drone hobby. [UAV Coach](https://uavcoach.com/how-to-fly-a-quadcopter-guide) looks like a good starting point.
3. Cooking over a charcoal grill. Unlike many enthusiasts, I started cooking over a gas flame and _graduated_ to a charcoal grill. I quickly learned to never use starter fluid. Instead, I use a charcoal chimney. Charcoal can be somewhat messier, but I like the flavors better and it feels less "canned." The potential volatility of propane also made me uneasy sometimes. Cooking around a grill is a great way to connect with family and friends. [Weber's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/GrillwithWeber/videos) is a good source for expert grilling tips.
